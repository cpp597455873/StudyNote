To create a functional test for your Activity, 
your test class should extend ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2.
 Unlike ActivityUnitTestCase,
tests in ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2 can communicate with the Android system and send keyboard input and click events to the UI.



Send Keyboard Input Using Instrumentation发送键盘指令
If your Activity has an EditText field, you might want to test that users can enter values into the EditText object.
Generally, to send a string input value to an EditText object in ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2, you should:
Use the runOnMainSync() method to run the requestFocus() call synchronously in a loop. This way, the UI thread is blocked until focus is received.
Call waitForIdleSync() method to wait for the main thread to become idle (that is, have no more events to process).
Send a text string to the EditText by calling sendStringSync() and pass your input string as the parameter.
For example:

// Send string input value
getInstrumentation().runOnMainSync(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        senderMessageEditText.requestFocus();
    }
});
getInstrumentation().waitForIdleSync();
getInstrumentation().sendStringSync("Hello Android!");
getInstrumentation().waitForIdleSync();
