Create the Layout
In your activity's layout XML file, set the android:animateLayoutChanges attribute to true for the layout that you want to enable animations for. For instance:

<LinearLayout android:id="@+id/container"
    android:animateLayoutChanges="true"
    ...
/>
Add, Update, or Remove Items from the Layout
Now, all you need to do is add, remove, or update items in the layout and the items are animated automatically:

private ViewGroup mContainerView;
...
private void addItem() {
    View newView;
    ...
    mContainerView.addView(newView, 0);
}
